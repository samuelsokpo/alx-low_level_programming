## Project Description:newspaper:
 
In computer science, a search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, either with discrete or continuous values

You will be asked to write files containing big O notations.
```
O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
n*m -> O(nm)
n square -> O(n^2)
sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
log(n) -> O(log(n))
n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
```

## General Objectives:bulb:
 
* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Tasks:clipboard:
 
### [0. What's my status? #0]
* Write a Python script that fetches https://intranet.hbtn.io/status
 
 
### [1. Response header value #0]
* Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the value of the X-Request-Id variable found in the header of the response.
 
 
### [2. POST an email #0]
* Write a Python script that takes in a URL and an email, sends a POST request to the passed URL with the email as a parameter, and displays the body of the response (decoded in utf-8)
 
 
### [3. Error code #0]
* Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the body of the response (decoded in utf-8).
 
 
### [4. What's my status? #1]
* Write a Python script that fetches https://intranet.hbtn.io/status
 
 
### [5. Response header value #1]
* Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the value of the variable X-Request-Id in the response header
 
 
### [6. POST an email #1]
* Write a Python script that takes in a URL and an email address, sends a POST request to the passed URL with the email as a parameter, and finally displays the body of the response.


### [7. Error code #1]
* Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL and displays the body of the response.
 
 
### [8. Search API]
* Write a Python script that takes in a letter and sends a POST request to http://0.0.0.0:5000/search_user with the letter as a parameter.
 
 
### [9. My Github!] 
* Write a Python script that takes your Github credentials (username and password) and uses the Github API to display your id
